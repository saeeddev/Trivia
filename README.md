### Summary

A 2-player competitive trivia game that uses Wikipedia, Youtube, and Twitter APIs as part of its hint system.

### Details
- Two players can challenge each other to different multiple choice trivia questions drawn from the <a href="https://opentdb.com/">OpenTDB database</a>.
- Players can choose from 10 different categories and 3 different difficulties.
- For a point cost on any question, a hint can be drawn from Wikipedia, Youtube, or Twitter.

### Instructions

- Use 'quick start' to immediately start a game with a medium difficulty question in the general knowledge category.
- Use 'custom game' to set player names, length of game (from 5, 10, or 15 questions for each player), and the initial difficulty and category of the first question.
- After answering a question, chose a question for the next player by selecting a difficulty and category. Or leave it up to chance by pressing 'randomize'!
- Press any hint button to search the respective source for a hint. Most hints are helpful, but due to the API search mechanics, not all hints are relevant. Good luck!
- Press the 'instructions' button at any time to see the full details of the game.
- Press the 'reset' button at any time to go back to the intro screen.
- Turn the background music and sound effects on or off at any time by clicking the sound switch.
